DATABASE AS A SERVICE

1. pymongo enables python code to communicate with the database
2. the links part means web service depends on the db
3. so the db should build before the web service
4. docker-compose is used as the base of communication between the 2 services
that's the web and the database (web and db)
5. the password encryption was done using bcrypt
